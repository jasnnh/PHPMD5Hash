Generating a MD5 Hash from a file or even string can be done through a web browser as well

of a file then grabbing that file and getting a MD5 Hash from the file.

The 3 CIA Triad:
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability

using Hasing to protect the integrity of the file.

In order to use this file you must have a webserver running PHP or it will not work.
